## Data 
**Title**: ABS-education-and-employment-1410.0
**Data Description**: 
The “Education and Employment, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-19” (14100do0005_2014-19.xlsx) data is one of the data cubes within the “1410.0 - Data by Region, 2014-19” collection by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The ABS is the national statistical agency in Australia that provides a wide range of data on economic, population, environmental, and social issues. The “Education and Employment, ASGS and LGA, 2011, 2014-19” data includes Australia’ education and employment data between 2014 and 2019 with various Australian Statistical Geography Standards (ASGS) such as Australia, State and Territory, Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSA), SA2, SA3, SA4, and Local Government Area (LGA). 

We transformed this ABS data to an easy-to-process format and saved it to a new CSV file called “transformed_data.csv” in this repository.
